Tanay's Dotfiles
================

Archiving this since I've switched to KDE form this complicated setup. Will keep this for reference.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Caution, this repo is just ment to sync with local dotfiles, please do not edit any files here directly
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These repository consist of configs that are explicitly edited by me and will be needed in the future in case I need to setup another system with similar config.
You are free to copy-paste parts or complete config, without holding me responsible for anything on your system that breaks and is difficult to recover from. I will not be investing any time in case of any such incident happens.

Syncing config from $HOME to current repository
-----------------------------------------------

`make update` will copy all the updated config from your directories to the current repositories if not up to date

`make install` to install all the necessary tools, make sure that you are running arch linux
